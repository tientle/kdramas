They have ordinary jobs, he works at a bookstore and she at the fitness club. Neither is extremely good-looking, nor rich, nor charismatic. But there is something different about them, and as the story reveals the reasons behind their divorce, their continuing meetings after divorce, their mingling in each other's lives, their matchmaking attempt for each other, and their internal monologues about each other, it becomes apparent they are each other's destiny if such thing exists. But even so, getting back together might be asking too much, since that would open up a wound that they've tried to bury for three years. Furthermore their new love-interests, Mi-Youn and Hyeon-Joong are marking their steps into Dong-Jin and Eun-Ho's lives, and the new love might just be a wiser option for two that have tried but failed already.

When a dutiful wife and loving mother realizes that she has lost a sense of who she is, the fates provide a murderously good way for her to find herself. Shim Jae Bok (Ko So Yung) is a legal assistant and mother of two. She can't stand it when things are unfair. She also hates the people who look down on her because she is a working ahjumma (older woman). Plus, she's got a temper that would make sailors blush. Still, Shim Jae Bok puts up with all the condescension and false flattery around her. That is because Shim Jae Bok's life is not about her; it's about her family, and the future of her kids depends on her bowing her head and staying respectful. This means that Shim Jae Bok even puts up with the the fact that her husband Goo Jung Hee (Yoon Sang Hyun) is having an affair with the much younger Jung Na Mi (Im Se Mi from Shopping King Louis). Plus, her boss from hell Kang Bong Goo (Sung Joon from Hyde, Jekyll and I), tells her she is out of a job. Her life is in a tailspin, and then something miraculous happens. Shim Jae Bok receives an offer for an apartment from Lee Eun Hee (Jo Yeo Jung from Divorce Lawyers in Love), an offer that is way too good to be true. Suddenly, the miracle becomes a disaster. The eccentric ahjumma finds herself in the middle of a murder mystery. All the chaos in her life comes full circle, and Shim Jae Bok realizes that someone is destroying her life, piece by piece. Now, our ahjumma has to regain her true self--the kind who fights injustice and doesn't tolerate nonsense--in order to save what she has left. But when you have spent years pretending to be perfect, is it even possible to be yourself? Also known as Perfect Wife, Ms. Perfect is directed by Hong Seuk Ku (Golden",6.6

Yoon Gae Hwa is a housewife divorced from a rich husband who needs to earn enough money to keep her daughter in her custody while her ex-husband's new wife doesn't want the daughter of a previous wife around. Gae Hwa's sole prior work experience is 6 months as a reporter for a weekly scandal rag. Her first jobs shown in the series are unsuccessful but include 1 day as housekeeper for Sung Min Woo where a babysitting emergency forces her to leave early, infuriating Sung Min Woo. Shortly afterwards, she finds another job at a musical production company, learns a secret about Sung Min Woo, and convinces him to work on the agency's musical, and becomes Min Woo's handler for that agency as it prepares to put on a musical starring Min Woo (if he ever improves as an actor). Handling Min Woo is no easy task due to their mutual antagonism, spurred by Min Woo's immaturity. Min Woo grows up as he faces the challenges of caring for his unexpected 5-year-old daughter Ye Eun, the result of an affair several years earlier, and by Gae Hwa's example in caring for the otherwise unprotected Ye Eun. Min Woo gains maturity very quickly as he learns to accept and love his daughter and becomes something unexpected - a good actor.
